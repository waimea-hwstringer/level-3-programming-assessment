# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

## Moving through the map

This is to test that the player can move between different locations on the map. There are four main movement
 buttons: up, down, left & right. The buttons should only be enabled if there is a room in that position. Eg.
if the player is in room1 and room2 is to the right of room1, the only movement button enabled would be the
right button.

### Test Data To Use

Move through the map, and check if the rooms have correct movement buttons shown. Eg. in the Sea, only the
up button should be enabled. Main entrance is above the sea, and in that room all movement buttons should be
available. Next, to the right is the East Corridor. In that room, only the down button should be disabled.

### Expected Test Result

With the rooms stated above, the movement buttons should be enabled & disabled accordingly.
